Starting with minecraft version 1.7.10, Server owners will need to accept the end user licence agreement(EULA).

You can read the EULA here: https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula

NodePanel will generally prompt you for an acceptance of the EULA when necessary, however if this is not the case, you will need to manually accept it by editing the eula.txt file and change eula=false to eula=true either via FTP, or NodePanel's File Manager.
