With the introduction of Minecraft 1.7.10, Mojang added a feature to allow server owners to customise their servers even further than what has been possible in the past. The addition of server icons for the multiplayer server list allows identification of your server to your players much easier.

#### Icon Specifications

+ Size: 64x64 pixels
+ Format: PNG image


#### Creating the icon

Creating the server icon generally requires the use of image editing software such as GIMP, or Photoshop. GIMP is a very popular choice, as it provides many of the powerful features within Photoshop, however is completely free for personal use. 

You will need to ensure the image is saved as a PNG, as well as 64x64. GIMP offers a great tutorial for resizing images in their documentation, which you can find at: http://docs.gimp.org/2.6/en/gimp-tutorial-quickie-scale.html



#### Uploading the icon

Once you've created your server icon and are ready to upload it, you'll first need to make sure it's simple named "server-icon". The Minecraft server will automatically use this image, if it's present in your server root directory, or relatively, "/". You can either upload this very simply via our web based file manager, or via FTP.
