Making a player an OP (Operator, Administrator) on your server is a easy task. The easiest way is to login to your server control panel, then go to console and type
"op <playername>" (remove the <> and playername is the player you want OP'ed)

NodePanel also makes this task extremely easy with the ability to edit OPs directly from our configuration page;
