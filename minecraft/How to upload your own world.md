Before starting this task, you need to stop your server. Changes cannot be made while the server is running.
To upload your own world, first stop your server and then connect to your server via FTP. Use this FTP article to learn more about FTP. Alternatively, you can use our web-based file manager, and these instructions should correlate effectively.

Once connected, you should see a group of folders. Locate the folder with your world name; typically its name is just "world". See screenshot below:

Open the folder you've identified as your world your server uses, and delete all the files and folders inside of it. Make a backup if you wish to keep that world or anything from it.
Once everything is deleted, you'll need to upload the contents of the new world. Ensure you upload the correct files and folders, as it will not function otherwise. The world your uploading should have a data folder, level.dat file, and a few other folders and should look something like this:

Once you've uploaded the world you can start your server and the change should have been made.
