Most, if not all popular modpacks run on a version of Minecraft Forge. Assuming the modpack or server you are running runs on this server JAR, you can easily setup a bukkit supported server. Before starting, make sure you you've installed the modpack you want to play from our server jar catalog (configure -> server jar).



## Installing Cauldron

Cauldron, formerly MCPC+, is a version of Forge which is built using Spigot to give the server Bukkit plugin support. Installation Cauldron is as simple as the setup process for any other modpack in our server jar catalogue (configure -> server jar -> install new server jar/modpack). Simply select Cauldron, the game version (must be identical to the game version of your modpack), and build of Cauldron you want to install (it's typically best to use the latest build unless you're familiar with specific build versions). **The most important step is to ensure you use the Install Type: Overwrite**. See the screenshot below for an example:

Click Install, and start your server up! Note: Our system will remove fastcraft from your mods folder if it exists, as it is incompatible with Cauldron.
