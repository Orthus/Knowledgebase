We understand how frustrating it can be when you cannot join your server. Please review these items to ensure your server is working properly:

#### 1. Is your server Started or Online?
There are literally hundreds of thousands of ways to play Minecraft. Some of the more complicated modded servers can take minutes to start, just like your client does. Our control panel monitors your server and will set its status to "Online" as soon as it's ready to start accepting players. 



#### 2. Did your server crash?
Sometimes a server will crash. Our control panel monitors your server and will let you know when it crashes. Crash logs are almost always saved in the /crash-logs folder. These logs can yield useful information that are generally best provided to mod authors / pack curators.



#### 3. Have you checked the console?
Sometimes the information you need will have been output by the server and into the server console - always check here to see if you found the problem. Common problems may be the Minecraft EULA or "/fml confirm" command.



#### 4. Can you connect to your server's IP?

We have thousands of IP addresses to manage in our system and on rare occasions, one IP may not work as intended. You can test to see if your server's IP works by Performing a Ping test. If you get a response from this test; your server's ip is functioning and responding.
