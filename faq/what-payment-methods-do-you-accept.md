# What payment methods do you accept?
We currently offer two different methods of payment for our customers:


1. PayPal Payments

PayPal has become the standard for making payments online. With a PayPal account, you are welcome to make payments without storing your payment information on our website, by storing it on PayPal's service.


2. Debit/Credit Cards

We use a PCI certified payment gateway which stores our customer card information off-site. NodeCraft never has access or stores your card details on our servers. If, for any reason, our servers are compromised, you can rest assured that your card details will not be retrieved.
