**PayPal**:

1. Login to your PayPal account
2. Select "**History**" from the top navigation bar.
3. Click "**Find a transaction**" next to your balance.
4. Use the search feature to search for "**payments@getnodecraft.net**" in the email field.
5. Select “**Details**” next to the transactions you require an ID for. The “**Unique Transaction ID**” will appear at the top of the details page. It is a long, alphanumerical string.

**Credit/Debit Card**:

For a credit/debit card, you will need to either use an online banking service to retrieve this, or by checking your physical bank statement.
