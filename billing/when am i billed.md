## When will I be invoiced?
Our systems are designed to give you a week to make a payment on your invoice. With any service you have with us, you will receive your invoice 3 days before its due date and have 3 days after its due date to pay before the service is suspended due to non-payment. All of our packages are designed to setup monthly payments for service.

### Will I be charged automatically?
By default, our system will attempt to collect payment 3 days prior to the due date on any given invoice. This is the same date that your invoice is generated. You can disable this by changing your billing settings here or by contacting our support representatives. Note: We only take automatic payments on Debit/Credit Cards.
