We understand that sometimes gaming has to take a backseat to other more pressing financial responsibilities. If you ever find yourself unable to make a payment before service suspension, you simply need to contact our support representatives and we can certainly give you some flexibility by extending the date until your service is suspended.

### What happens after my service is suspended?
After the day your service is suspended, you have 2 weeks until our system automatically terminates your service from our system. You can make payment anytime during these two weeks to automatically restore your account. After your service is terminated you will need to create a new order and contact our staff about transferring your old server data to the new service.

### What happens to my service files/data?

The files associated with your service will be retained for a minimum of 2 months before they are deleted from our servers. At any time you can request these files, no matter if your service is active or not. As long as we have these files, our staff will never refuse to provide you with them.
