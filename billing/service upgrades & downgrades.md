You are welcome to upgrade or downgrade your service at any time. When you make a change to your plan, you first need to understand that your service will receive a prorated refund or credit based on the size of the package you are changing to and length of service you have paid for.

## What does pro-rata mean?
When you have a pro-rata charge or refund it means that the price between your current service and the newly upgraded/downgraded service is different. We calculate the price based on what you've already paid minus the days that have already passed in your current billing cycle. The pro-rata refund or charge is simply the difference of those amounts.
